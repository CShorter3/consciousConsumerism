    <p>The production process of consumer goods should be considered when analyzing
    relationships between businesses. In this regard, our area of interest focuses
    on the impact of consumerism in McClurg Dining Hall. In order to evaluate the
    impact of the relationship between McClurg and its suppliers, we will consider
    factors including: the traveling distance of goods, the commercial size of the
    business, and the ethical labor involved in its production, which all play
    essential roles in conscious consumerism. Given this analysis, stakeholders
    have more information to maximize the University&#146s positive influence.
    Furthermore, our project will provide greater transparency and a visual
    representation for Sewanee&#146s effort to foster an even greater
    community by being considerate of the needs, goals, and the resulting
    relationships conidering these factors, especially those in our extended
    Appalachian communities.

    <h2>Message From Chef Rick</h2>
            <p>"You vote with your fork, everytime you participate in eating 
            a food you increase the liklihood that it shows up again. The choices you
            make perpetuate the ways in which food is prepared and sourced. Dont take 
            your food for granted, see how it is connected and affects other cultures."
