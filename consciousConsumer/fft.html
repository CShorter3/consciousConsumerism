      <p> It can be very powerful to reframe the way we think about food and the many influences 
          that determine our understanding of food as a concept. Access to affordable and adequate
          food is a privlege that should be used to drive positve social change. An individual 
          decision as a consumer can influence a growing effort to inspire social responibility or 
          inadvertnly perpetuate detrimental effects on either ones own health
          or indirectly on another person's community.</p>
 
 <div id="first">
    <h2> Education/ Awarness to realize social responsibility</h2> 
      <p> Be skeptical!</p> 
      <p> Consider the trade offs between the good and bad effects 
          that any consumer/supplier interaction has on both parties
          (as the consumer themselves and the opposing supplier).<p>
      <p> Clarify understanding of the food industry and relevant 
          practices to prevent common misconceptions about food
          (ie. locality and marketing misconceptions).  </p>
  </div>

  <div id="sec"> 
  <h2>Act on social responsibility to positively impact communities </h2>    
  <p> Care about the effects of your impact as a consumer <p>
  <p> Recognize your privledge<p>
  <p> Pursue interactions that drives positive social change of a particular intrest</p> 
  <p> Vote with your fork and find other ways to expand your concept of food! <p>
  </div>
      
  <div id="third">
    <h2> Influence culture within communities to practice better consumer pracices</h2>
      <p> Cultures who share more extensive mental maps of food should practice better
          consumer practices especially when doing business </p>
      <p> Communties can continue to learn from changing systems that effect people's
          relationship with food like the World War for example, and Capitlistic 
          societies as well</p>
      <p> Consider how technology might affect the worlds relationship with food and
          the tradeoffs of such change.</p>
